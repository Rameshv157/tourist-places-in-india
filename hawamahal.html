                    The Hawa Mahal was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur.
                    Its unique design was conceptualized by Lal Chand Ustad, a skilled architect who designed it in the form of the crown of Lord Krishna, which is said to have inspired Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh.
                    The primary purpose of the Hawa Mahal was to allow the royal women to observe everyday life and festivals in the street below without being seen, as they had to observe strict purdah (seclusion) customs.

                    The Hawa Mahal is a five-story pink sandstone structure with a beautiful façade adorned with intricate latticework (jali) and over 950 small windows, known as jharokhas.
                    Its unique design allows cool air to pass through the windows, providing natural ventilation and air conditioning, which helped keep the palace cool during the hot summers of Rajasthan.
                    The palace's pyramidal shape and the numerous small windows resemble the shape of a honeycomb or the crown of Lord Krishna.

                    The main attraction of the Hawa Mahal is its stunning façade, which looks like a delicate screen made of pink sandstone.
                    The palace is best viewed from the street outside, where its beauty and intricacy can be fully appreciated.
                    While the exterior is its most famous feature, the interior of the Hawa Mahal is relatively simple, with narrow corridors and small chambers.
