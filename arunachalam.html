                    Arunachalam Temple is closely associated with the sacred Mount Arunachala, which is considered a manifestation of Lord Shiva himself.
                    According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva once manifested as a column of fire (Lingam) on the hill of Arunachala to put an end to a dispute between Brahma and Vishnu, who were competing for supremacy.
                    The temple is believed to be one of the Pancha Bhoota Stalams, representing the element of fire (agni), with the other four temples representing the other elements.
