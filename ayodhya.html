                    Ayodhya is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama, a major deity in Hinduism and the central figure of the epic Ramayana.
                    The site of the Ram Janmabhoomi (birthplace of Rama) has been a focal point of Hindu-Muslim conflict and controversy for centuries due to the presence of a mosque known as the Babri Masjid, which was believed to have been built by the Mughal Emperor Babur in the 16th century.

                    The dispute over the ownership of the site escalated in the 20th century, leading to legal battles and communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims.
                    In 1992, the Babri Masjid was demolished by Hindu nationalist groups, triggering widespread riots and violence across India.
                    The demolition of the mosque resulted in legal proceedings and calls for the construction of a Hindu temple at the site.

                    In November 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered a landmark verdict in the Ayodhya dispute, granting the site to Hindu parties while directing the government to allocate an alternative plot of land to the Muslim parties for the construction of a mosque.
                    Following the court's verdict, the construction of the Ram Mandir began in August 2020, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi laying the foundation stone for the temple.
                    The temple is being constructed according to traditional Hindu architectural principles and is expected to become a symbol of Hindu pride and unity.

                    The design of the Ram Mandir is inspired by ancient Hindu temple architecture, particularly the Nagara style of temple architecture prevalent in North India.
                    The temple complex will include a grand sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha) housing the main deity, Lord Rama, along with other shrines, courtyards, and facilities for pilgrims.
