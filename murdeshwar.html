                    According to Hindu mythology, the temple is said to be built on the site where Lord Shiva, in the form of a Lingam (symbol of Shiva), is believed to have appeared before Ravana, the demon king of Lanka.
                    The legend goes that Ravana was carrying the Atma Lingam (a divine Lingam) from Mount Kailash to Lanka to attain immortality. Lord Vishnu intervened to prevent Ravana from achieving his goal, and as a result, Ravana accidentally dropped the Lingam at the spot where the temple now stands.

                    The main attraction of the Murudeshwar Temple is the towering 123-feet (37 meters) tall statue of Lord Shiva, which is one of the tallest Shiva statues in the world. The statue is situated right next to the temple complex and is surrounded by the Arabian Sea on three sides, offering breathtaking views.
                    The temple itself is built in a Dravidian architectural style, with intricate carvings and sculptures depicting various mythological scenes from Hindu scriptures.
                    The sanctum sanctorum houses the Lingam believed to be the one dropped by Ravana, and devotees offer prayers and perform rituals to seek blessings from Lord Shiva.
